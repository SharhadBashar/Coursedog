What happens for Beef Cake
1. daysRemaining  > 0 AND quality  > 0 -> daysRemaining - 1 AND quality - 2
2. daysRemaining >= 0 AND quality == 0 -> daysRemaining - 1 AND quality unchanged
3. daysRemaining <= 0 AND quality irr  -> daysRemaining - 1 AND quality - 4
                                       -> daysRemaining always decremented by 1 
4. quality can never go below 0. SO quality = max(quality, 0)
